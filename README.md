# SMPG_TOOL
This is a **functional** python stable version of the original Excel-implemented SMPG tool. New changes are under construction in another repository and they're comming next months. This code is not currently standarized according to PEP8, it's just a **functional experiment**, so it must not be considered as a professional project yet.


### RUNNING SCRIPT
This code actually needs many dependences (such as NumPy, SciPy, Tkinkter, Matplotlib, etc). Verifiy that you actually have these modules already installed in your computer.

**1.** First clone this repo in a local directory inside your computer by using the next instruction in your command window:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/JeaustinSirias/SMPG_TOOL
```
**2.** Move to the cloned directory by using your command window and type:

```
$ make run
```
The GUI must be popping up in your screen now
